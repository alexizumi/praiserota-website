                                <h3>The Problem I Lived Every Week</h3>
                                <p>
                                    For over 15 years, I've been serving as both a pastor and worship leader.
                                    Every single week, I faced the same frustrating challenge that I know you're
                                    familiar with too ‚Äì managing our worship team rota.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The endless spreadsheets that broke when someone made a change. The WhatsApp
                                    messages flying back and forth trying to coordinate availability. The Sunday
                                    morning panic when someone couldn't make it and we had to scramble for a replacement.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I watched fellow worship leaders spending hours every week on what should be
                                    a simple task. We were all using our IT and creative skills to serve God's
                                    kingdom, but we were stuck with stone-age tools for team management.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div className="story-section">
                                <h3>The "Why Not?" Moment</h3>
                                <p>
                                    With my background in IT and software development, I'd already built several
                                    systems for our church to enhance both in-person and online experiences.
                                    But somehow, I'd never tackled the weekly headache that affected me most personally.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One particularly stressful Sunday morning, after dealing with yet another
                                    last-minute scheduling crisis, I thought: "Why not do something about this?"
                                    If I could build systems to improve other areas of church life, surely I
                                    could solve this problem that every worship leader faces.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's when the vision for Praise Rota was born ‚Äì not in a boardroom or
                                    as a business opportunity, but in the real, messy, beautiful world of
                                    worship ministry.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div className="story-section">
                                <h3>Built with Worship Leaders in Mind</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Praise Rota isn't just another scheduling app adapted for churches.
                                    It's purpose-built by someone who understands the unique challenges of
                                    worship team management because I live them every week.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I know what it's like to need a last-minute keyboard player. I understand
                                    the delicate balance of rotating team members fairly while ensuring quality.
                                    I've experienced the frustration of unclear communication leading to
                                    confusion on Sunday morning.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Every feature in Praise Rota comes from real worship ministry experience.
                                    This isn't theoretical ‚Äì it's practical solutions for real problems that
                                    I and my fellow worship leaders face every single week.
